# The Boathouse Restaurant

## Introduction

As part of my Diploma  in full stack software development with Code Institute I am required to complete 5 mile stone projects. For my first milestone project, I have created a website for a mock-up website for a restaurant based in Garryvoe, Co. Cork, Ireland for educational purposes.

Please click [HERE](https://andrewmcm98.github.io/The-Boathouse-Restaurant/) to view my website.

I have focused on responsiveness across all devices for design.

## Who is this website for?

This a website providing detail and information for a mock-up restaurant based in Garryvoe, Co. Cork, Ireland. This website has been created to offer customers additional detail about the opening hours, menu, prices, location and general about information for the company to give a customer insight into the products on offer, and who we are.
Additionally, I have included a call to action in providing a section on each page on how to find the restaurant with engaging contact & booking forms to promote customer engagement with the website.
This is a perfect method for restaurants to show case their restaurant, and products whilst engaging with the customer to provide the customer with plentiful information to come dine here.

## The Owner

The owner of this website is me, Andrew McMahon, the developer as this is based on a mock-up restaurant for education purposes to demonstrate my competence in this project.
However, this website can be easily adapted to many other restaurants and is designed to show case the restaurant to attract customers and actively engage with the customer through contact and booking forms, making it easy for the customer to find us.

## What does it do?

This a website providing detail and information for a mockup restaurant based in Garryvoe, Co. Cork, Ireland. This website has been created to offer customers additional detail about the opening hours, menu, prices, location and about information for the company to give a customer insight into the products on offer, and who we are.

## User Experience

2. Menu Page

On navigating to the menu page the user will be provided with a clear menu detailing the courses available with the appropriate pricing.
Through reserach online via youtube tutorials and primarily W3 Schools, I was able to create a responsive flex layout.
![View of menu](assets/images/menu-page.png)
3. Gallery Page

On navigating to the menu page the user will be provided with a gallery providing plentiful photos of the cuisine on offer, restaurant layout internally and externally.
Through reserach online via youtube tutorials and primarily W3 Schools, I was able to create a responsive flex layout which will scale the photos up or down accprding to the device.
For example, in the first image you see the gallery from a smaller device which provides a view of the image's without much of a need to scroll, however in the second image we see larger image's on a desktop which requires a user to scroll.

4. Contact Us & Booking page

On navigating to the contact-us or booking page the user will be provided with a form to be completed and can then be submitted to the restaurant on successfully filling out the sections of the form.
Through reserach online via youtube tutorials, W3 Schools and code institute lessons, I was able to create a responsive form which can be accessed on multiple devices without distortion.
Additionally, I have styled the form text boxes to appear as a responsive background color when being typed in with a hover effect as displayed in the images below.
Furthermore, I included placeholder text to assist the user in what each section requires to be submitted.

## Validator Test

### W3C CSS Validator

On testting my website via direct input on the W3C Css Validator, no errors were found. However, imported style sheet such as google fonts are not checked and is out of my control.
![CSS Valid](assets/images/css-valid.png)

### W3C Markup Validator

On testing my HTML on direct input I note I recieved errors on the main home page, gallery page and booking page as displayed in the below images.
#### Main Home Page

On review of the HTML validator I note it stated, The element: a must not appear as a descendant or the button element.
Therefore, I removed the button HTML and proceeded to use an anchor link element, of which I styled this to appear as a responsive button, of which this removed this error.
![HTML Error1](assets/images/htmlerror1.png)
#### Booking Page

On review of the HTML validator I note it stated, 
- The element footer must not appear as a descendant of the header element
- End tag for: body : seen, but there were unclosed elements
- Unclosed element header
Therefore, I proceeded to correctly indent the code layout and close the header and body element, of which this issue was corrected with no further errors.
![HTML Error2](assets/images/htmlerror2booking.png)
#### Gallery Page

On review of the HTML validator I note it stated,
- Section lacks heading. Consider using h2 - h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections
However, whilst I note this error/warning suggestion, this page is designed to be a gallery with little to no text of which we have a heading confirming it to be the gallery with alt attributes describing the images for screen reader accessibility.
![Section Headings](assets/images/sectionlackheadings.png)
#### Final Test

On final testing of the HTML Validator and direct intput with no applicable error or warnings, I completed a URL check which also confirmed there to be no further errors.
![Corrections](assets/images/noerroronupdating.png)

### My own testing including Responsiveness

On completion of the Validators, I carried out my own tests on devices ranging from Ipone 6 to Iphone 12 pro max, Ipad Air, Macbook Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy s10, which displayed the website perfectly with no issues on my assessment.

Furthermore, I also used Google chrome developer tools to test responsiveness on multiple devices which all displayed the content correctly.

## Deployment

### Version Control

For my project I used [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) as a local repository and IDE, whilst I utilised [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

##### The process of version control

The version control process was as follows,
1. I first began with creating a new repository on Github with the compulsory code institute template. I done so by navigating to the code institute template provided as part of the course lessons, and selected "use this template", and proceeded to create a project name.
2. Once a repository was created I clicked, "Gitpod" which created a new workspace for me to begin coding my project.
3. I then proceeded to code, create files, asset folders and upload images for use throughout my project.
4. On completing my coding for the evening I would then have to save the code I created. To do so, I would first ensure I have saved all files, and changes made whilst coding by hitting "cmd S" on my macbook.
I would then navigate to the bottom of the gitpod workspace and select terminal.
Once in the terminal bash window I would type the following commands,
- git add . - This would select all files within the workspace
- git commit -m "text" - This would enable me to provide a bried description of the work I completed
- git push - This would then push all the code to Github where it is updated & saved

### How to Deploy your project

On completion of a project you will proceed to deploy the website in the following steps,
1. On Github, select your project you wish to deploy 
2. Once on the project you wish to deploy, navigate to Settings
3. Click on setting and scroll to pages
4. Then select pages, and go to the heading Sources
6. Under sources you will see a dropdown box, select this and pick main branch 
7. Once you have selected master, ensure to keep the file as the root directory and save
8. Once saved you will be presented with the websites URL which will become active after a few minutes loading time, of which you can view and share

### How to clone this repository

In order to clone a repository, you should follow the below steps,
1. On Github, select the project you wish to clone
2. Once you have selected the project you wish to clone, navigate to the main page of the repository and click on the large icon, "Code"
3. Once you have clicked on this icon, you will recieve a drop down, of which adjacent to the HTTPS address there will be a copy option
4. Click on the copy option and proceed to the gitpod workspace 
5. In your gitpod workspace, proceed to the terminal at the bottom of the screen, and enter the following command with the copies https address as follows, git clone https-etc...
6. Then press enter to create a cloned repository
